# Blutix

## About this project
Bluetix is an event ticketing platform designed to cater to both customers and event organisers. What sets it apart is its innovative use of blockchain technology within its ticketing system that brings several key advantages, including enhanced security, transparency, and protection against spoofing. Bluetix aims to streamline transactions and create a more trustworthy environment by leveraging blockchain technology to mitigate scalping. This will work alongside a priority queuing system to ensure fairness in ticket allocation. All of this is executed with a user-centric design in mind, while ensuring scalability.
